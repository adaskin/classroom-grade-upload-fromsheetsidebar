# upload grades from sheet to google classroom
A google app-script to upload grades from google spreadsheet to classroom assignment (the assignment must be created from app-script in order to have access).

The application creates a spreadsheet menu which creates a sidebar to specify email columns and grades and upload them to specified assignment.. The code is written for personal use in one of my course work and may include some serious bugs. So make sure to test it first on dummy data.
